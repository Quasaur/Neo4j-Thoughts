/Users/Developer/DJANGO/book-of-thoughts contains the predecessor project to /Users/Developer/DJANGO/wisdom-book .

Take the contents of the /Users/Developer/DJANGO/book-of-thoughts/backend/thoughts_api app and appropriate/adapt its contents to /Users/Developer/DJANGO/wisdom-book/backend/neo4j_app - this will be the engine that will interact with the Neo4j AuraDB instance that exists on the Internet and supply data to the other apps of the wisdom-book project.
