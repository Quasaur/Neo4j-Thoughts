What is the most popular web development library or framework with which to create a Neo4j AuraDB-driven website? Include all applicable programming languages in which webdev frameworks and libraries are created in your answer.

Several popular web development libraries and frameworks are commonly used to create websites powered by a Neo4j AuraDB backend. Here are some of the most notable ones across various programming languages:

### JavaScript
1. **Node.js with Express**: A popular choice for building web applications in JavaScript, Express can be easily integrated with Neo4j through the Neo4j JavaScript driver.
2. **React**: For front-end development, React can be paired with a Node.js and Express backend to create dynamic web applications that utilize data stored in Neo4j.
3. **Vue.js**: Another front-end framework that can be used with a Node.js backend, making it suitable for applications that require interactions with Neo4j.
4. **Apollo GraphQL**: Useful for building real-time data applications with a GraphQL server, it can interface with Neo4j using the Neo4j GraphQL library.

### Python
1. **Django**: A high-level web framework that can work with Neo4j through the `neo4j` Python driver. It allows for rapid development and a clean design.
2. **Flask**: A lightweight web framework that can easily connect to Neo4j using its Python driver, providing flexibility for building RESTful services.

### Java
1. **Spring Boot**: A robust framework for developing Java applications, it can integrate with Neo4j using the Spring Data Neo4j module, allowing for easy interaction with the database.
2. **Micronaut**: A modern JVM framework designed for building modular and testable applications, offering support for Neo4j through its data access capabilities.

### Ruby
1. **Ruby on Rails**: A popular web application framework, it can use gems like `neo4jrb` to integrate easily with Neo4j databases.

### C#
1. **ASP.NET Core**: A high-performance framework for building web applications, it supports integration with Neo4j through available client libraries such as Neo4jClient.

### PHP
1. **Laravel**: A well-known PHP framework, it can be integrated with Neo4j using packages such as `Vinelab/NeoEloquent`, allowing developers to use Eloquent-like syntax.

### Go
1. **Gin**: A lightweight web framework for Go that can be used with the Neo4j Go driver to create efficient web services.
2. **Revel**: A high-productivity web framework for the Go language that can also be integrated with Neo4j.

### Elixir
1. **Phoenix**: A highly productive web framework for the Elixir language, it can connect to Neo4j using the Bolt protocol and libraries like `bolt_sips`.

### Summary
While many frameworks can be used to develop Neo4j-powered websites, the most popular ones tend to be in languages such as JavaScript (Node.js, Express), Python (Django, Flask), and Java (Spring Boot). The choice of framework often depends on the specific requirements of the project and the developer's expertise. Each of these frameworks can effectively integrate with Neo4j AuraDB, enabling rich data-driven applications.
