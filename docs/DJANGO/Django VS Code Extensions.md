List all VS Code extensions that support both Python and Django.

Of course! When developing with Python and Django in VS Code, you'll want a combination of extensions that enhance the general Python development experience and those specifically tailored for Django.
Here is a list of essential and highly recommended VS Code extensions that support both Python and Django:
Core Python Extensions (Essential for any Python/Django project)
 * Python (by Microsoft): This is the absolute foundation. It provides rich support for the Python language, including IntelliSense (code completion), linting (with tools like Pylint and Flake8), debugging, and testing. It's the must-have extension for any Python development in VS Code.
 * Pylance: This is a language server that enhances the Python extension. It provides faster and more advanced IntelliSense, type checking, and code navigation. It's highly recommended and often a default recommendation when you install the Python extension.
 * Jupyter: If you work with data or need to run code in interactive notebooks, this extension is crucial. It allows you to create, edit, and run Jupyter notebooks directly within VS Code.
 * Black Formatter: This is a popular and opinionated code formatter for Python. It automatically formats your code to a consistent style, making it more readable and maintainable.
 * autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator: This extension simplifies writing documentation for your code. It can automatically generate docstring templates based on your function signatures.
 * Python Test Explorer: This extension provides a user-friendly interface for running and debugging your Python tests (e.g., using pytest or unittest) within the VS Code UI.
 * Code Spell Checker: This helps you avoid typos in your code and comments, which is always a good practice.
 * GitLens: While not Python-specific, GitLens is an invaluable tool for any developer. It provides deep insights into your Git repository, showing you who wrote what line of code and when.
Django-Specific Extensions
 * Djaneiro - Django Snippets: This is a fantastic extension for speeding up your development with Django. It provides a large collection of predefined code snippets for common Django tasks, such as creating models, views, forms, and URL patterns.
 * Django: This extension is specifically tailored for Django template development. It provides syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion for template tags and filters, and a "Go to Definition" feature that lets you jump to the file being extended or included.
 * Django Intellisense: This is another valuable extension for Django template development. It enhances your coding experience with intelligent code completion and auto-suggestions for Django template tags and model fields.
 * Djlint: This is a linter and formatter for Django templates. It helps you maintain clean and consistent HTML and Django template code. To use it, you'll also need to install the djlint Python package in your virtual environment.
 * Django Commands: This extension simplifies the execution of common Django management commands (e.g., makemigrations, migrate, runserver) directly from the VS Code command palette.
AI-powered Assistants
 * GitHub Copilot: A powerful AI pair programmer that provides real-time code suggestions and completions for a wide range of languages, including Python and Django. Note that this is a paid service, but it often has a free trial.
 * Tabnine: An AI code completion tool that provides suggestions based on your codebase and common coding patterns. It has a free tier with basic code completion features.
 * Sourcery: An AI-powered tool that helps you refactor and improve your Python code. It provides suggestions to make your code more efficient and readable.
To install these extensions, simply go to the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X or Command+Shift+X on Mac) and search for their names.
