Kimi K2 Prompts for Development Assistance
Here's a series of prompts you can use with Kimi K2 to enhance your development process, focusing on Python, Django, ReactJS, and UI/UX/backend best practices. Remember to be specific and provide context.
General Project Setup & Structure:
 * "I am setting up a Django and React project named 'wisdom-book'. The backend is in a backend/ folder and the frontend in a frontend/ folder. I need to ensure good project structure and separation of concerns. Can you suggest a typical folder and file structure for both the Django apps and the React components, keeping scalability and maintainability in mind?"
 * "What are the best practices for handling environment variables in a Django-React project, specifically for Neo4j AuraDB credentials and API keys? Provide a clear example using python-dotenv for Django and a .env file for React."
Django Backend Development (Python, neomodel, REST Framework):
 * "I have a Neo4j AuraDB with Topic, Thought, Quote, Passage, and Tag nodes. Using neomodel in my neo4j_app Django app, how should I define the Topic and Thought StructuredNodes, including relationships between them (e.g., a Thought RELATES_TO a Topic)? Also, show me how to create a Tag array property on these nodes if they can have multiple tags."
 * "For my neo4j_app, I need an API endpoint that returns all data (nodes and relationships) from the Neo4j AuraDB for a D3.js visualization. Write a Django REST Framework APIView and the associated neomodel query in db_utils.py to fetch this data efficiently, formatted for D3.js (list of nodes, list of links)."
 * "I'm developing a topics_app in Django. How can I create a REST API endpoint that allows filtering Topic nodes by a keyword in their name or description properties, and also allows pagination? Provide the views.py, serializers.py, and urls.py code."
 * "Design a Django signal handler that automatically updates a 'last_modified' timestamp on Thought nodes whenever their content or associated tags are changed via neomodel."
 * "What are crucial security considerations for a Django backend consuming a Neo4j AuraDB API? Specifically, advise on securing API endpoints, protecting sensitive data, and preventing common web vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, XSS)."
React Frontend Development (ReactJS, D3.js, Tailwind CSS):
 * "I'm building the GraphViewPage.js in React using D3.js to visualize Neo4j data. Given that my Django API endpoint /api/neo4j/graphdata/ returns nodes and links arrays, provide a basic D3.js force-directed graph implementation within a React component. Include basic node styling with Tailwind CSS classes for the container and a loading state."
 * "For the left sidebar menu in my React app (App.js), I'm using react-router-dom and Tailwind CSS. How can I implement a responsive sidebar that collapses on smaller screens and expands on larger ones, with active link highlighting using Tailwind classes?"
 * "I need to implement a search function for tags_app in my React frontend. When a user types into a search bar, I want to send a request to my Django API (e.g., /api/tags/search/?q=keyword) and display the results dynamically. Provide the React component code, including state management and API fetching with useEffect and useState."
 * "When displaying Thought or Quote content fetched from Django, how can I ensure proper sanitization and rendering of potentially rich text (e.g., if the content includes basic Markdown or HTML) while preventing XSS vulnerabilities in React?"
UI/UX Best Practices (General):
 * "Given the menu items: Home, Graph View, Topics, Thoughts, Quotes, Passages, Tags, Donate, what are UI/UX best practices for designing a consistent and intuitive left sidebar navigation in a web application? Consider aspects like visual hierarchy, hover states, active states, and accessibility."
 * "For the data display pages (Topics, Thoughts, Quotes, Passages), suggest UI/UX patterns for presenting lists of items efficiently. How can I incorporate filtering, sorting, and pagination controls effectively using Tailwind CSS for styling and React for functionality?"
 * "What are some best practices for designing interactive elements in a D3.js graph visualization, such as node click events to show details, tooltips on hover, and basic pan/zoom functionality, ensuring a smooth user experience?"
 * "Considering the donate_app, what are crucial UI/UX design principles for building a donation or subscription page to maximize user trust and conversion? Think about clarity, security indicators, and call-to-action placement."
Backend Best Practices (General):
 * "What are the key considerations for optimizing Django REST Framework API performance for an application that fetches potentially large graph data from Neo4j AuraDB? Discuss caching strategies, query optimization, and serialization techniques."
 * "How can I implement robust error handling and logging in my Django backend to effectively diagnose issues, especially when interacting with an external API like Neo4j AuraDB? Provide examples for logging exceptions and API call failures."
 * "Discuss strategies for testing my Django backend applications, including unit tests for neomodel interactions, integration tests for API endpoints, and how to effectively mock external services like AuraDB during testing."
By using these targeted prompts, Kimi K2 can act as a powerful assistant, providing code snippets, architectural advice, and best practice recommendations for your wisdom-book project. Remember to iterate and refine your prompts based on the responses you receive.
