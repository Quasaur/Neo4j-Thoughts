For the new Topics page:  
1. The Topics page is similar to the Start Here! page in that it also must have two Cards: the Card on the left of the Topics page Content Area will have its variable named T_Card_01 and the Card on the right of the Topics page Content Area will have its variable named T_Card_02.  The two Cards will be the same width.
2. T_Card_01 will have the Heading "Topics". T_Card_02 will have the Heading "Selected Topic Detail."  
3. T_Card_01 will display a table populated with all the Topics stored in the table located in the Django admin section named TOPICS_APP. The displayed table will have two columns named "Topic Level" and Topic Name", respectively. "Topic Level" will correspond to the field "LEVEL" in the Topics backend table. "Topic Name" will correspond to the field "TITLE" in the Topics backend table. The table in T_Card_01 will be sorted by the LEVEL column ascending and by the TITLE column ascending. The first row should have the title "Topic ZERO: THE NULL TOPIC". When the table in T_Card_01 is ccompletely populated, make sure that row (the first row) is selected as though the user had left-clicked on it with the mouse pointer. When the first row is selected, populate T_Card_02 with all of the details of the selected Topic in T_Card_01.
When you have completed this task, i will give you specific instructions on how the selected Topic's detail should be displayed in T_Card_02.
