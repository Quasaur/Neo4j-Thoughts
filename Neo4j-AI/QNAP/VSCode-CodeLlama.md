# Q:
Does a VSCode extension exist that will allow me to connect with my local Ollama / Codellama agent from within VSCODE? Can my Codellama agent write and edit code within VSCode?
# A:
Yes, there are several VSCode extensions that allow you to connect with your local Ollama/CodeLlama setup and have the AI assist with code directly within the editor:

## Popular Extensions:

**Continue** - This is probably the most popular and feature-rich option. It supports Ollama out of the box and allows you to:

- Chat with your CodeLlama model in a sidebar
- Use inline code completion
- Edit code directly with AI assistance
- Highlight code and ask questions about it
- Generate code from natural language descriptions

**Ollama** - The official Ollama extension provides basic integration for chatting with your local models.

**CodeGPT** - While primarily designed for OpenAI models, it also supports Ollama and other local LLMs.

## What CodeLlama Can Do in VSCode:

With these extensions, your CodeLlama agent can:

- **Write new code** - Generate functions, classes, or entire files based on your descriptions
- **Edit existing code** - Modify, refactor, or improve code you’ve selected
- **Explain code** - Analyze and explain what code does
- **Debug assistance** - Help identify and fix issues
- **Code completion** - Provide intelligent autocomplete suggestions
- **Generate comments and documentation**

## Setup:

1. Install the extension (Continue is recommended)
2. Configure it to use your local Ollama endpoint (usually `http://localhost:11434`)
3. Select your CodeLlama model in the extension settings
4. Start coding with AI assistance!

The integration is quite seamless - you can highlight code, right-click for AI options, or use keyboard shortcuts to invoke the AI directly in your workflow.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
