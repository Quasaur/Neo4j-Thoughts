List all free artificial intelligence models capable of coding in Python and Django and are available on the web that do not charge a monthly fee.

Here is a list of free artificial intelligence models and tools that can assist with coding in Python and Django, available on the web without a monthly fee.
Open-Source Models and Platforms
 * Gemini CLI / Gemini Code Assist: This is a powerful, open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into your terminal and IDE (like VS Code and JetBrains PyCharm). It is free for individual developers with a personal Google account, offering a large context window and high request limits. It excels at coding, can understand your code's context, and can generate and transform code.
 * Tabby: Tabby is an open-source, self-hosted AI coding assistant. This means you can run it on your own machine or server, giving you full control over your data and privacy. It provides code completions and suggestions.
 * CodeT5: CodeT5 is an open-source model designed for code generation and understanding. It can be used to create reliable and bug-free code.
 * FauxPilot: This is a self-hosted, local alternative to GitHub Copilot, allowing you to run a code completion model on your own hardware.
Web-based Tools with Free Tiers
 * Workik: Workik offers an AI-powered code generator with a free tier. It provides broad assistance for Python and Django development, including code generation, debugging, testing, and optimization. It can produce Django-specific code snippets, models, and views.
 * Refact.ai: Refact.ai provides a free Python Code Generator that uses models like GPT-4o-mini without requiring a login. It can generate, explain, and optimize Python code and supports different frameworks like Django.
 * Syntha AI: This platform has a free AI-powered Django Code Generator that can quickly create code snippets and prototypes. It focuses on generating Django-specific code, such as ORM models and viewsets.
 * Aider: Aider is an AI-assisted pair programming tool that works directly within your terminal and integrates with local Git repositories. It is a command-line tool that can help with various coding tasks.
 * Qodo (formerly CodiumAI): This platform helps developers write, test, and review code with its AI-powered features. It offers a free tier to get started with its code generation and testing tools.
 * Replit: Replit is an online collaborative coding platform that includes a free tier with an AI tool called "Ghostwriter." It provides contextual code suggestions and assistance.
 * JetBrains AI Assistant (within PyCharm): While the full AI Assistant in JetBrains IDEs is a paid feature, they often offer free trials and it's worth checking their current free usage limits for personal use, as they may have free tiers for specific models or features. It has strong support for Django development.
 * ChatGPT (Free Version): While not a dedicated coding assistant, the free version of ChatGPT is a powerful language model that can be used to generate Python and Django code snippets, brainstorm ideas, debug issues, and explain code.
 * Google Colab: While not a code generator itself, Google Colab is a free platform for running Jupyter notebooks in the cloud, which can be used to run and develop Python code. You can use it in combination with free AI models to write and test your code.
Important Considerations:
 * Self-hosting vs. Cloud: Models like Tabby and FauxPilot require you to host them on your own hardware, which can be more complex to set up but offers greater privacy and control. Web-based tools are easier to use but your code is sent to their servers for processing.
 * Usage Limits: Even free services often have usage limits (e.g., number of requests per day or month). Make sure to check the specific terms of service for each platform.
 * Context Awareness: Look for models that can understand the context of your project (e.g., your existing code, files, and project structure) for better and more relevant code suggestions. This is a key feature of tools like Gemini Code Assist.
