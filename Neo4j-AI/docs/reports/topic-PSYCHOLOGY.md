# Thought: REACTION
[!Thought-en]
Feeling is the reaction of the flesh to circumstance. Feeling is not Truth. Just because you feel angry it doesn't mean you should be.

[!Pensamiento-es]
El sentimiento es la reacción de la carne ante las circunstancias. El sentimiento no es la Verdad. El hecho de que te sientas enojado no significa que debas estarlo.

[!Pensée-fr]
Le sentiment est la réaction de la chair aux circonstances. Le sentiment n'est pas la vérité. Ce n'est pas parce que vous ressentez de la colère que vous devez l'être.

[!सोचा-hi]
भावनाएँ परिस्थितियों के प्रति शरीर की प्रतिक्रिया हैं। भावनाएँ सत्य नहीं हैं। सिर्फ़ इसलिए कि आपको गुस्सा आ रहा है, इसका मतलब यह नहीं है कि आपको गुस्सा आना चाहिए।

[!思考-zh]
感觉是肉体对环境的反应。感觉不是真理。你感到生气并不意味着你应该生气。
