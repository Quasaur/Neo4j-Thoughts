No worries — here are your keys from earlier in this chat. Copy them into the app's Setup sheet:

| Field                                | Value                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Key (Consumer Key)**           | ```<br>d3VbWwV3x9ZDsOBwDkCzcwEnn<br>```                          |
| **API Secret (Consumer Key Secret)** | ```<br>Dotg1Oj9v8RXtGm7eKxcBfLivtWPaPn4VrjqJHN7LRrnaoGXvn<br>``` |
| **Access Token**                     | ```<br>1723453026428428288-Lvs0r2cOLeB1U71giPdxLOBXmf5bcJ<br>``` |
| **Access Token Secret**              | ```<br>iTuaJsrSOOUReRnQao8sbuHQ9Jm3tZJx0ntzENjCeH6LB<br>```      |

Once saved in the app, they'll be stored in your macOS Keychain so you won't need them again. I'd recommend also saving them to a secure note (Apple Notes or a password manager) as a backup, since the X Developer Portal won't show them again.
