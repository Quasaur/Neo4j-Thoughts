# Q:
i'm now going to reboot and test the remote connection; if this works, you will show me how to test the remote connection without a monitor, keyboard or mouse.
# A:
Perfect! Go ahead and reboot to test the remote connection.

Once you confirm the VNC connection is working after reboot, I'll show you several methods to test and manage your headless (no monitor/keyboard/mouse) setup:

## Methods I'll cover for headless testing:

1. **SSH connection** - Primary method for remote command-line access
2. **Network scanning** - Verify the system is up and VNC is listening
3. **Ping testing** - Basic connectivity verification
4. **Port checking** - Confirm VNC service is running remotely
5. **Wake-on-LAN** - If you need to wake the system remotely
6. **System monitoring** - Check system status remotely

These techniques will let you fully manage and troubleshoot your Zorin system even when it's completely headless - very useful for a server setup or when the system is in a remote location.

Go ahead and test the reboot, then let me know if the VNC connection works as expected!
