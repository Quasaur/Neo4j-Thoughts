All of the THOUGHTS in the Book_of_Tweets folder that have data for the YAML property "ptopic" can be inserted into the Neo4j AuraDB instance.
I have verified the integrity of every THOUGHT node.
I have either approved or changed the parent TOPIC you suggested.
Where i have created new parent TOPICs, i have already inserted the new TOPICs in the Neo4j AuraDB instance.
After the new THOUGHTS have been inserted into the Neo4j AuraDB instance, you can move them to the content/THOIUGHTS folder and change the YAML property "neo4j" from false to true.
