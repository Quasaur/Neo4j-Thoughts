What’s the difference between Django version 4 and Django version 5 and why do modern AI models (like Claude.ai) recommend version 4 over version 5? Also, provide URLs for short yet informative YouTube videos about today's development trends on how quickly Django version 5 is being adopted.

Here's a summary of the differences between Django 4 and 5, reasons why AI models might recommend Django 4, and some YouTube videos related to Django 5 adoption:
Key Differences Between Django 4 and 5:
 * Python Compatibility: Django 5 supports Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12, while discontinuing support for older versions like 3.8 and 3.9.
 * New Features in Django 5:
   * Facet Filters in Admin: Provides a more intuitive way to manage and filter data in the Django admin interface.
   * Simplified Form Field Rendering: Introduces "field group" templates to reduce HTML complexity.
   * Database-Computed Default Values: Allows setting default values for model fields using database functions.
   * Generated Fields: Enables creating database-generated columns directly within Django models.
 * Removed/Deprecated Features in Django 5: Several features deprecated in earlier versions have been removed in Django 5, including USE_L10N, USE_DEPRECATED_PYTZ, and support for pytz timezones.
Why AI Models Might Recommend Django 4:
While the search results don't explicitly state why AI models would recommend Django 4 over 5, some articles suggest that Django's complexity might be a factor. AI/ML engineers with a more scientific background might prefer simpler frameworks. Django's full-stack nature and the added complexity of Django REST Framework for APIs could be seen as less straightforward compared to micro-frameworks. However, Django's robust security features and suitability for complex applications are also highlighted as strengths, especially for AI-driven projects.
