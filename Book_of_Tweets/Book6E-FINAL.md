#  Preface {#preface}

The voice of the wise, as expressed in wisdom literature, reaches back into prehistory. From oral traditions long since forgotten to the shared wisdom in our tweets, the communication of experience and knowledge has continued wherever tribes, clans and families have roamed across the face of our planet.

In honor of this priceless Gift of Heaven I publish this collection of wisdom that I myself have gleaned in my brief life. I first started sharing these as tweets beginning in late 2008, shortly after I had registered with Twitter. Last year I had the good sense to save the 2,400 or so tweets I had created by that time, which was a good thing: there is a 3,200-tweet access limit. Using TweetBackup I exported the most recent 3,200 tweets so that I could, from a complete collection, publish my original material in this book.

I've arranged the tweets in chronological order of 23 tweets per chapter. When completed (if I chose to publish no more "tweetverbs") that would come to around 29 chapters (excluding retweets and non-wisdom material).

In any case, it is my prayer that you, Kind Reader, will find something here to give you guidance, wisdom and (most of all) a more Heavenly perspective.

X06-Feb-2009: Winning is fun and success is great; but far more fulfilling is standing firm and being true!

X07-Feb-2009: We are all figments of the Divine Imagination\--and what an Imagination!

X12-Feb-2009a: Love is so much more than just a feeling\...It\'s a decision to treat someone as good or better than you treat yourself!

X12-Feb-2009c: If every person is an Act of God, what can my wife teach me about God?

X18-Apr-2009h: That which is Ultimate cannot be Ultimate unless \"it\" (He) is also PERSONAL.
